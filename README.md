# S3 	24SJPBCST304 Object-Oriented Programming in Java Lab 🎓

Welcome to the **S3 Object-Oriented Programming in Java Lab Programs Repository**!  
This repository houses Java programs developed during the **Object-Oriented Programming with Java (24SJPBCST304)** lab course in the third semester of the **Computer Science Engineering Program at SJCET, Palai**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each `.java` file represents a lab assignment aligned with the 24SJPBCST304 program syllabus. Filenames are descriptive for easy navigation, for example:

```plaintext
📁 S3-Java
├── HelloWorld.java
├── Calculator.java
├── EmployeeInheritance.java
├── ShapePolymorphism.java
├── FileReadWrite.java
├── ThreadDemo.java
└── README.md         # Repository documentation
```

## 🧩 Key Features

* ✅ Beginner‑friendly Java implementations with helpful comments
* 🧠 Full coverage of OOP concepts—inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation
* 🔧 Practical exercises in exception handling, file operations, and threads
* 📚 Topics aligned with 24SJPBCST304 lab requirements 

## 🎯 Course Objectives

According to 24SJPBCST304 syllabus, this lab covers:
* Core Java programming and control structures
* Object-oriented principles: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes
* Method overloading and overriding, constructor use
